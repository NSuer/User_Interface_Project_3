## Design
### 1. Choose a UI to fix
We decided to fix the Blinkee website, https://blinkee.com/

On first glance, we noticed several things that could be improved, some of those are:
- "Qty Discount" Button - They displayed the price for this with the label "Bulk." They should use the same wording to keep correlation.
- Footer - The whole footer is a mess. It takes up half of the screen, two long vertical lists, duplicate navigation buttons (Checkout, My Account/Account), and the Home navigation only at the bottom.
- They added a Christmas theme to the home page that moves and it's very distracting, it's linked to their Christmas themed blinkees but why wouldn't that be on the main page?
- "Custom Blinkee" - Button in the navigation leads to a completely new website with no way to get back.
- Products Page - This page isn't structured overly well. Doesn't stick with the four per row theme of the main page and is somewhat hard to differentiate between the different items.

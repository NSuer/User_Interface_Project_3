## Design
### 1. Choose a UI to fix
We decided to fix the Blinkee website, https://blinkee.com/

On first glance, we noticed several things that could be improved, some of those are:
- "Qty Discount" Button - They displayed the price for this with the label "Bulk." They should use the same wording to keep correlation.
- Footer - The whole footer is a mess. It takes up half of the screen, two long vertical lists, duplicate navigation buttons (Checkout, My Account/Account), and the Home navigation only at the bottom.
- They added a Christmas theme to the home page that moves and it's very distracting, it's linked to their Christmas themed blinkees but why wouldn't that be on the main page?
- "Custom Blinkee" - Button in the navigation leads to a completely new website with no way to get back.
- Products Page - This page isn't structured overly well. Doesn't stick with the four per row theme of the main page and is somewhat hard to differentiate between the different items.

### 2. Redesign research, data, planning
Chosen Methods
- Expert heuristic evaluation
    - To complete this method, we will read through each of the linked articles on the “Heuristic evaluation” Canvas page. After reading through each of the heuristics, we will determine which are most applicable to our chosen website. We will then determine if each of the chosen guidelines is addressed by the current website. For those that are not yet addressed, we will figure out the best way to implement it in our redesign.

    - Chosen Heuristics
        - Visibility of System Status
            - This guideline is prevalent throughout the website, as it is always important to let the user know where they are. This guideline is addressed by the "You Are Here:" text on every page of the website (aside from the home page). However, when the user clicks on the "Custom Blinkees" menu item in the navigation bar, they are taken to a new website. While the site does look different, it can be a bit difficult to realize it is a completely new website at first. In this case, the user is not notified of where they are. In our redesign, we will either make the LogoBlinkee.com site be built into the original Blinkee.com website or have a message that shows the user was taken to a new website. 

        - User Control and Freedom
            - This guideline is prevalent any time the user starts a process or does an action. Blinkee.com does support the undo and redo buttons on one's search engine, but there are not many "exits" built into the site itself. On the checkout page, there is no clear cancel button. The user can adjust the quantity of an item being ordered or completely remove it, but navigating away from this page requires the user to either click "blinkee.com" after the "You Are Here:" text or use the navigation bar to access a different page. Another example of where this guideline needs to be addressed is what happens when the user clicks the "Custom Blinkee" menu item. This button takes the user to a completely different website with no options to return to Blinkee.com without pressing the undo button offered by the search engine. To address this guideline, we will include cancel, exit, or undo buttons on almost every page to ensure the user never gets stuck and always has a clear exit. 

- Observational study with a think aloud protocol
    - To complete this method, we will recruit at least three participants and have them complete a series of tasks on the current Blinkee website. Because this website could be used by a wide variety of people, we will attempt to have some variation in our participants, especially in terms of age. The set tasks could include things such as ordering a certain item, making a custom Blinkee, navigating the shopping cart, and more. We will record the screen as participants work through these tasks, and we will ask them to think aloud as they do so. After all of the participants complete the study, we will compare what they said while completing the tasks to best identify difficulty points. 

    - Tasks: 
        1. Add 3 "Multicolor Star Infinity Tunnel Necklaces" to the shopping cart
        2. Add at least 1 "Masquerade Silver Unlit Metallic Mask Mardi Gras" to the shopping cart
        3. Navigate to the shopping cart. From here, remove all of the "Multicolor Star Infinity Tunnel Necklaces: and add at least 1 "Masquerade Silver Unlit Metallic Mask Mardi Gras." Make sure these changes are reflected in the price of all the items in the shopping cart. 
        4. Navigate to the "Custom Blinkees" page. Start the process of creating a custom Blinkee by uploading an image to the correct page. Add at least one LED to the custom page and make the LED fade. Once finished with the custom Blinkee, return to the original website without using your search engine's browser. 
        5. Find the return policy for Blinkee.com and start a return. 

- System Usability Scale
    - To complete this method, we will make a questionnaire that contains all ten of the SUS statements. We will ask the participants from the observational study to complete this questionnaire after they finish with the tasks. We will then follow the steps outlined by the linked website on the Canvas page to score this UI and determine how good its usability is. This overall score, along with the scores for each of the individual statements, will help us evaluate the usability of the site and identify areas for improvement.
